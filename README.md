Description: This software is a music playlist manager. Users can create and manage playlists, add songs to them, and search for songs or artists within them.

• Who are the users of the software?: The users of the music playlist manager software can be music enthusiasts, casual listeners, or anyone who wants to organize and manage their personal music collections and create customized playlists.

• What is the purpose of the software?: The purpose of the music playlist manager software is to provide users with a convenient and organized way to create, manage, and customize their music playlists, allowing them to enjoy their favorite songs and artists seamlessly.

• Where and when will the software be used?: The music playlist manager software can be used on personal computers or laptops by individuals at any time they desire to curate and manage their music playlists.

• How does the software work?: Upon launching the application, the user is presented with a user-friendly GUI where they can interact with the software.
The user is provided with options to create a new playlist, load an existing playlist, or manage existing playlists.
If the user chooses to create a new playlist, they can give it a name and optionally add a description.
The new playlist is then added to the list of available playlists.
Once a playlist is created or loaded, the user can add songs to it.
They can either manually enter the details of the song (e.g., title, artist, album) or import the song information from an online music database (such as querying an API like Last.fm).
The software allows the user to view and manage the songs within a playlist.
They can see the song details, such as title, artist, and duration, and perform actions like removing songs, rearranging the song order, or editing the song information.
The user can also apply various sorting options to the playlist, such as sorting by title, artist, or duration.
This helps them organize their music collection according to their preferences.
The software also provides a search functionality, allowing the user to search for specific songs or artists within the playlist. This makes it easier to locate and play desired songs.
Additionally, the application can offer features like shuffle play, where the songs in the playlist are played randomly, and repeat play, allowing the user to repeat the playlist continuously.
The user can save the playlist, including all the added songs and their order, to a file. This allows them to load the playlist later or share it with others who can import it into their own music playlist manager.
The software also provides visualization options, such as displaying album art or generating basic statistics about the playlist, like the total duration or the number of songs.

• Why would anyone want to use the software over existing processes?: The software provides a centralized and user-friendly interface for managing music playlists, offering features like easy song addition, sorting, searching, and playback controls, which streamlines the process and enhances the user's ability to organize and enjoy their music collection more efficiently compared to manual methods or other existing software.
